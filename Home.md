            <h2>What is a Sitekick?</h2>
            <p>A Sitekick is your very own personal robot friend! Sitekicks run on things called ‘Chips’. By installing different Chips, you can do all sorts of cool things with your Sitekick – like customizing its appearance, trading with others, playing games and more. Chips are largely obtained through the Dump or by trade with other players, but more codes and alternate methods are planned for the future.</p>
            <p>For a list of all Sitekick chips, click <a href="/Home/Sitekick/Chipendium">here</a>.

## Remastered? What happened to the original?

Sitekick was originally a game that overlayed the broader [YTV.com](/Home/YTV/) website, an official online portal for the Canadian national children's broadcasting station of the same name. YTV premiered across the country on September 1st, 1988 and remains on the air today.

Sitekick was originally implemented to the site in 2003 and removed in 2015 following legacy code issues. Despite this, Sitekick is a significant source of nostalgia for many Canadian millennials, and this project aims to preserve knowledge and assets from this time, as well as develop a new full-featured version of the Sitekick game.
