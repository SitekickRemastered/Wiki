## How can I help out?
Check out the [Join the Team](https://sitekickremastered.com/join-the-team/) page if you're a programmer, artist, or writer. For everyone else, spreading the word is the best way to help out. Do you have a Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, ~~Twitter~~ X account? Perhaps you're part of a Discord server full of 20-30 year old Canadians? Post a picture and see who remembers our little robot friends. You could even use a custom Sitekick avatar on social media. [More info here](/Home/Sitekick/Characters/SitePic)

## Are there / will there ever be Microtransactions?
No. We're developing Sitekick Remastered because we liked the original. Adding any form of monetization would ruin the experience for the players. Sitekick Remastered will **never** be monetized. 

## Where can I find chips?
Right now, 99% of chips are spawned in the dump. The other 1% will be distributed via [codes](/Home/Sitekick/Chipendium/Codes) or other methods at a later date.

## Can I play the Sitekick SAGA minigames?
This is a planned feature, but we likely won't be making it until after 1.0 is out.

## When are updates and events?
Sitekick Remastered is developed by a small team in our spare time. It's a passion project, so we don't have any ETA on updates or events. We release updates when they're ready, and run events when we have time.

## When will iOS be supported?
We don't own any Apple devices, and Apple has yet to approve our developer account, so we mostly just recommend buying an Android or using an Android emulator.  99% of people have either an Android device, Windows computer, or Xbox. iOS is too niche to be worth the resources.

**tl;dr Maybe some time after 1.0 is out.**

## How did you remake Sitekick?
One of our developers found a copy of some of the game files in an old backup. We found the rest of the game's assets were found on Archive.org. We were able to decompile the old game files and export them at a high resolution and slap them into Unity. Then, with enough time and some tomfoolery, Sitekick Remastered pops out.
