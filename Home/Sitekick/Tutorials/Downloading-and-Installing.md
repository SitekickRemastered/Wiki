## Absolutely and Completely Unsupported
Sitekick Remastered is not available for iOS devices.  It is only available on Android, Windows, and Xbox.  You can however install an Android emulator on an iOS device as long as you have a **jailbroken** device.  If you don't have a jailbroken device, you will be unable to play.

If you're comfortable with Jailbreaking your iOS device, you may be able to install UTM (iOS 11 or higher), install an Android emulator, then install Sitekick Remastered from within the emulator.

We don't provide any support or how-to for jailbreaking your device or installing UTM, but you can read more about each below:

Jailbreaking information can be found on[TheiPhoneWiki.com](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Jailbreak)
UTM documentation can be found on [getutm.app](https://docs.getutm.app/)
