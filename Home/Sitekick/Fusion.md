## What is Fusion?
Fusion is a feature allowing multiple chips to be combined to create a chip of Unique rarity. As Unique chips cannot spawn in the dump, this is the only way to obtain certain chips.

## How does it work?
Fusion is simple.  Equip fusable chips on the CHIP tab then open the MAIN tab.  If you equipped the right combination of chips and click/tap in the right location, you'll see a brand new chip appear.  When you tap the chip, the fusable chips will be consumed, and your new chip will be in your inventory.

## How do I know what chips can be fused?
The Development team will include a note in the [changelog](https://sitekickremastered.com/change-log/) stating which new chip(s) can be fused. It's up to the community to figure out the right combination! Fusion combinations will always make sense, for instance BunnyBasket is obtained by fusing the whole Bunny set.

# Fusion List
> There are currently no chips that can be fused. Fusion will be added in a future update.
