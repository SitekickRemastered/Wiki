# Chips
Your Sitekick is a highly customizable, thanks to these special little items called "Chips." As your Chip collection grows you can equip your Sidekick with them to give special effects like: becoming a music player, giving them a new eye colour, adding new limbs, and more.

In the original SiteKick game, chips would be obtained not only through chip dispensers around YTV.com, but also from entering codes as well. Codes can be found throughout various sources, such as games, newsletters, the WHOA! Magazine, and watching YTV during certain times in the day. By the time the game discontinued, there were 1,375 different chips to collect.

During YTV's revamp in 2010, many chips were redesigned, with some of them being replaced with completely different ones.

Some of the rarest chips on the site happen to be the winning entries of DACE contests.

Their descriptions can be read in the Chipendium.

## Rarities
Chips come in several rarities (see below). Rarities determine how often a chip may spawn in the dump, and how long they'll exist before despawning. Common chips can spawn every minute, while Legendary chips may only spawn every day or so. Unique chips can only be created by Fusion or by entering a Chip Code.

- Common
- Rare
- Legendary
- Unique

## Secondary Effects
Some chips have a secondary effect. For instance, all of the Dragon Wings chips start off as an egg, and will turn into equipable wings after a set amount of days. Some other chips play a sound, animation, or start a game when clicked on.
