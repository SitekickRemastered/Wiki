            <p>The Sitekick (invented by <a href="/Home/Sitekick/Characters/Dr-Frantic">Dr.Frantic</a> during <a href="/Home/Sitekick/Games/Saga">The SiteKick Saga</a>) is a robot and fictional character from <a href="/Home/YTV">YTV.com</a>.</p>
          <p></p>
            <p>In the game, players can customize their Sitekicks by equipping Chips. In the original game, players could use their SiteKick as their avatar on the YTV Messageboards by using the Camera Chip. In Sitekick Remastered, players can create and customize custom Sitekick avatars by messaging SitePic on Discord.</p>

## Physiology
The Sitekick is typically round and yellow in colour, with a pair of shiny purple eyes. Its body seems to be composed of at least five pieces of metal. Its core is a black, bubbly liquid, also known as the [Ooze](/Home/Sitekick/Ooze).

It also possesses an antennae with a round ball on the top. When the ball is clicked, the antennae retracts before the SiteKick bursts its shell open to reveal its core. The core then reveals the Chips that were in the Sitekick. If the user clicks on one the Chips, and that Chip happens to be a [Transformation Chip](/Home/Sitekick/Transformation-Chips), it will trigger the transformation.

## Official Sitekicks
While each Sitekick player creates their own Sitekick, there are a few named and designed by [YTV](/Home/YTV), as well as Sitekick Remastered.
